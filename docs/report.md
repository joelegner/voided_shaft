# Introduction

Transmission structures are used to elevate electric power lines to a safe distance above ground. The height exposes them to wind. In addition to wind, the power lines exert lateral forces. The combined effects of the wires and wind is an overturning moment which is termed _groundline moment_. Transmission structures can consist of latticed towers, structures with two or three vertical poles connected at the top, and even imaginitive structures like the Mickey Mouse shaped Mickey Pylon near Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, but the most common type being installed in the United States today is the monopole. Monopoles can be constructed using concrete or steel. Concrete monopoles are installed by the age-old method of direct burial. Steel monopoles can be directly buried, too. But large steel monopoles that develop too high of a groundline moment for direct burial are built with drilled shaft foundations.

Drilled shafts are deep foundations constructed by drilling a circular hole with an auger and filling the hole with concrete. The shaft is reinforced with a cage of vertical bars and ties. Drilled shafts can be large enough in diameter that they behave as mass concrete. With this comes the risk of a phenomenon called Delayed Ettringite Formation (DEF). DEF is a process by which the mineral ettringite forms after hardening is substantially complete. It does not involve sulfate from outside the cement paste -- a related process called _sulfate attack_. High hydration temperatures in mass concrete prevent the normal initial ettringite formation from occurring. As the hydration progresses and the temperature drops below a threshold, ettringite is able to start forming. Its expansive reaction develops tensile loads in the concrete which cause cracking damage and can lead to serviceability problems and structural failures.

## Transmission Line Structure Foundations

Drilled shafts for transmission line structures typically range between about 2.5 feet and 10 feet in diameter (IEEE 2001). Even larger diameters have been constructed. The diameter of a shaft may be dictated by the anchor bolt circle diameter and required edge distance rather than by geotechnical concerns. At the larger end of the range, DEF is a real concern.

Applications in the power industry / typical loads and shaft diameters presently and where voided shafts could be used.

# Background

Mitigating the concern with elan concrete and other low heat of hydration techniques is problematic, because the delayed curing also extends the length of the project. It would be better to find a way to construct large drilled shafts using conventional concrete or even high early strength mixes without DEF.

Background of the voided shaft concept and past demonstration project.

Possible structural code issues (is there a maximum internal cover thickness, does it need a central cage as well as the normal age?)

Methods of verification, testing. Things that a test may test: soil behavior, structural bending and shear resistance. Limits nt test configurations: may test soil well but does not impose the correct bending moment in the element. Power poles are weird,nt, moderate to high lateral forces, low axial load

Maybe a cost comparison: I recently got a quote for a cooling system for 7ft diameter, 25ft long shaft at \$25k. So, savings can be not only concrete removed vs. the cost of a permanent central casing.
